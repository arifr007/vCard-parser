# vcard-parser

vCard-parser is a simple vCard file parser with the focus on ease of use.

The parser was written mostly because I couldn't find one that I was satisfied with - all those that I tried either failed with real world data or were too unwieldy or inconvenient, hence this parser.

The parser can read both single and multiple vCards from a single file and with the help of PHP's magic methods and interfaces it can be written concisely.
